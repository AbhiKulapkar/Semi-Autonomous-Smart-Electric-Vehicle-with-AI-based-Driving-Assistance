## 📖 Project Overview
The **Semi-Autonomous Smart Electric Vehicle (SASEV)** is an innovative project that focuses on integrating AI-driven features into an electric vehicle. The primary goal is to enhance the driving experience by providing semi-autonomous capabilities that include smart parking, adaptive lighting, efficient battery management, and real-time pothole detection.

## ✨ Features
1. **🅿️ Self-Parking System**
   - Utilizes AI and sensor data to autonomously park the vehicle in tight spaces.
   - Supports both parallel and perpendicular parking.

2. **💡 Adaptive Headlight Intensity Control**
   - Automatically adjusts the headlight brightness based on ambient light conditions and the presence of other vehicles.
   - Enhances night driving safety and energy efficiency.

3. **🔋 Battery Management System (BMS)**
   - Monitors and manages the battery's state of charge, health, and thermal conditions.
   - Ensures optimal performance and longevity of the EV battery.

4. **🛣️ AI-Based Pothole Detection**
   - Real-time detection of potholes and rough terrains using AI algorithms and sensor data.
   - Provides warnings to the driver and adjusts the suspension system accordingly.

## 🛠️ System Architecture
The SASEV system architecture is divided into several key modules:
- **📡 Sensor Integration:** Collects data from various sensors (cameras, LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors) to perceive the vehicle's environment.
- **🧠 AI Processing Unit:** Processes sensor data using machine learning algorithms to make real-time decisions.
- **🔧 Control Systems:** Executes commands for steering, acceleration, braking, and other vehicle functions.
- **👤 Human-Machine Interface (HMI):** Provides the driver with feedback and options to interact with the system.
- **📡 Communication Module:** Enables V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication for enhanced situational awareness.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **🧠 Machine Learning & AI:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **💻 Programming Languages:** Python, C++
- **🔌 Embedded Systems:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino
