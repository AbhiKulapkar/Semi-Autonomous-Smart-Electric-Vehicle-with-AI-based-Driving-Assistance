Project Overview
The Semi-Autonomous Smart Electric Vehicle (SASEV) project focuses on enhancing the driving experience through the integration of AI-driven features. These features aim to provide a balance between automation and driver control, enhancing both safety and convenience in various driving conditions.

Key Features
1. Self-Parking System
Overview: Automatically parks the vehicle in both parallel and perpendicular spaces with minimal driver input.
How It Works: Using AI algorithms and real-time sensor data, the system identifies suitable parking spots, calculates the optimal path, and maneuvers the vehicle into the spot.
2. Battery Management System (BMS)
Overview: Monitors and optimizes the vehicle’s battery performance to extend its life and efficiency.
How It Works: The BMS tracks the battery's state of charge, temperature, and overall health, ensuring optimal performance through intelligent management of charging cycles and energy use.
3. Adaptive Headlight Intensity Control
Overview: Adjusts headlight brightness automatically based on environmental lighting conditions and oncoming traffic.
How It Works: Sensors detect ambient light levels and the presence of other vehicles, dynamically adjusting the headlights to prevent glare and improve night-time visibility.
4. Pothole Detection Using AI
Overview: Detects road irregularities such as potholes in real-time and alerts the driver.
How It Works: AI algorithms analyze data from onboard cameras and sensors to identify potholes, providing warnings and adjusting the vehicle’s suspension for a smoother ride.
System Architecture
The SASEV system is composed of several interconnected modules that work together to deliver a seamless driving experience:

Sensor Integration: A suite of sensors including cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and LiDAR gathers data from the vehicle's surroundings.
AI Processing Unit: Advanced machine learning algorithms process the sensor data to make real-time driving decisions.
Vehicle Control Systems: These systems execute commands for steering, acceleration, braking, and other vehicle functions based on AI outputs.
Human-Machine Interface (HMI): A user-friendly interface that provides real-time feedback and allows the driver to interact with the vehicle’s autonomous systems.
Power Management: Ensures the efficient use of energy, integrating the Battery Management System to optimize battery performance.
